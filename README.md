## Usage

1. Load the MNIST dataset by providing the path to the training and testing data files.
2. Preprocess the data, including normalization and reshaping.
3. Train the neural network model using the provided training data.
4. Test the trained model on the testing data to evaluate its accuracy.
5. Visualize the accuracy of the model during training using a plot.


## Future Scope

- Implement more sophisticated neural network architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to improve accuracy.
- Explore hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize the model's performance.
- Develop a user-friendly interface or application for handwritten digit recognition.
- Extend the project to recognize and classify digits in real-time using computer vision techniques.
